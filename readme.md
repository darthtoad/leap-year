# Leap Year

#### A program that can help you determine which years are leap years, Version 1: 12/5/17

#### By Sam Gespass

## Description

This application can help the end user determine whether a year is a leap year or not. If a year is divisible by 4, it's a leap year, but if it's divisible by 100, it is not a leap year. However, if it's divisible by 400, it is a leap year. Just open index.html in your favorite browser after downloading or cloning from GitHub, and have fun!
